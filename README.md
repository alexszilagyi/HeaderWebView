# HeaderWebView

Example iOS project that contains a custom UIView which can be used to display email contents, using an UIWebView and a UIView as the header (typical email information like to, from, cc, bcc and so on). It mimics the behavior of the native mail app. With the header scrolling up and down with the content but not moving on zooming on the webview

It also includes an example of supporting full screen (hiding/showing the navigation/toolbar on scolling). This is achieved through a simple protocol implementation.

Suggestions and feedback are totaly welcome.
