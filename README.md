# HeaderWebView

Example iOS project that contains a custom UIWebView that allows for the user to specify the header. It mimics the behavior of the native mail app. With the header scrolling up and down with the content but not moving on zooming on the webview

It also includes an example of supporting full screen (hiding/showing the navigation/toolbar on scolling). This is achieved through a simple protocol implementation.

Suggestions and feedback are totaly welcome.
